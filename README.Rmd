`nemsqar` is an R package designed to automate the calculation of EMS quality metrics as defined by the National EMS Quality Alliance (NEMSQA). With a focus on enhancing EMS service performance through reliable, evidence-based quality measures, `nemsqar` aims to streamline metric calculation for healthcare providers, EMS agencies, and researchers dedicated to improving patient outcomes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `nemsqar` with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("bemts-hhs/nemsqar")
```

Additionally, you may install the current version of `nemsqar` on CRAN via:

```r
install.packages("nemsqar")
```

## Functionality

`nemsqar` has functions that will always automate the calculation of a service's performance (or even a system's) against the currently approved list of NEMSQA Measures (see below).  Given the large number of these functions, please check the full package documentation resource [here](https://bemts-hhs.github.io/nemsqar/).

## About NEMSQA

The National EMS Quality Alliance (NEMSQA) is committed to developing and endorsing quality measures that improve patient and provider experiences within EMS and healthcare systems. Originating from the EMS Compass Project (2014), NEMSQA has evolved as an independent organization, tasked with completing and sustaining the development of impactful, evidence-based EMS quality measures.

### History of EMS Quality Measure Development

The structured development of EMS quality measures began with the EMS Compass Project, an initiative funded by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and led by the National Association of State EMS Officials (NASEMSO) to establish relevant performance measures for EMS agencies. Since then, the field has advanced under the guidance of NEMSQA, which works to create sustainable, practical, and high-impact EMS quality measures through a collaborative, scientifically driven process.

For more about NEMSQA, please visit their official website: [nemsqa.org](https://www.nemsqa.org/).

## NEMSQA Measure Set

The National EMS Quality Alliance (NEMSQA) Measure Set includes a comprehensive list of EMS quality measures that have been developed and approved for national use. These measures are intended to guide EMS agencies in collecting data to assess and improve patient care. Below are the measures approved by the NEMSQA Measure Development Committee and Board of Trustees as of August 2019. Access to the full technical specifications for these measures is available on the NEMSQA website after creating a user profile.
