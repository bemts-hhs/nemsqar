Description: Designed to automate the calculation of EMS quality metrics, 'nemsqar' implements 
             measures defined by the National EMS Quality Alliance (NEMSQA). By providing 
             reliable, evidence-based quality assessments, the package supports EMS agencies, 
             healthcare providers, and researchers in evaluating and improving patient outcomes. 
             Users can find details on all approved NEMSQA measures at <https://www.nemsqa.org/measures>. 
             Full technical specifications, including documentation and pseudocode used to develop 
             'nemsqar', are available on the NEMSQA website after creating a user profile at 
             <https://www.nemsqa.org>.
