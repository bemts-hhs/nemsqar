and escene fields as a fact table. Default is \code{NULL}.}

fields needed for this measure's calculations. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{erecord_01_col}{Column name containing the unique patient record
identifier.}

\item{incident_date_col}{Column that contains the incident date. This
defaults to \code{NULL} as it is optional in case not available due to PII
restrictions.}

\item{patient_dob_col}{Column that contains the patient's date of birth. This
defaults to \code{NULL} as it is optional in case not available due to PII
restrictions.}

\item{epatient_15_col}{Column containing age.}

\item{epatient_16_col}{Column for age units.}

\item{eresponse_05_col}{Column containing response mode codes (e.g., 911
response codes).}

text.}

\value{
A tibble summarizing results for the Adults, Peds, and all records
with the following columns:

\code{measure}: The name of the measure being calculated.
\code{pop}: Population type (Adults, Peds, All).
\code{numerator}: Count of 911 responses where "lights and sirens" were not used
in an EMS dataset.
\code{denominator}: Total count of incidents.
\code{prop}: Proportion of 911 responses where "lights and sirens" were not used
in an EMS dataset.
\code{prop_label}: Proportion formatted as a percentage with a
specified number of decimal places.
}
\description{
The \code{safety_01} function calculates the proportion of 911 responses where
"lights and sirens" were not used in an EMS dataset. It generates age-based
population summaries, calculating the count and proportion of "lights and
sirens" responses among all incidents, and within adult and pediatric groups.
