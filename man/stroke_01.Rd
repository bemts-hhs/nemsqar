\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{dplyr::summarize()} function for further customization of results.}
}
\value{
A tibble summarizing results for the total population with the following columns:
\code{pop}: Population type (All).
\code{numerator}: Count of incidents where beta-agonist medications were administered.
\code{denominator}: Total count of incidents.
\code{prop}: Proportion of incidents involving beta-agonist medications.
\code{prop_label}: Proportion formatted as a percentage with a specified number of
decimal places.
}
\description{
The \code{stroke_01} function processes EMS dataset to identify potential stroke cases based on specific criteria
and calculates the stroke scale measures. It filters the data for 911 response calls, identifies stroke-related
impressions and scales, and aggregates results by unique patient encounters.
}
\note{
This function filters and processes EMS data to:
\itemize{
\item Identify stroke cases based on primary and secondary impression codes.
\item Filter for 911 response codes and relevant vital signs (e.g., GCS, AVPU).
\item Aggregate results by patient encounter and calculate stroke scale outcomes.
\item Return a summary of stroke cases by unique patient identifier, including stroke scale measurements.
}
}
\section{Data Assumptions}{


This function assumes that:

Data are already loaded into a data frame or tibble where each row represents
one observation (e.g., patient) and each column is a dplyr::distinct feature (field).
Alternatively, data may consist of separate datasets referenced by unique columns.

Missing values in rows are represented as \code{NA}. "Not known" or "not recorded" values,
common to ImageTrend or other non-numeric codes, should be pre-cleaned before use.

The \code{eresponse_05_col} contains NEMSIS response codes and may also include
descriptive text for reference.

The vital signs columns \code{evitals.23}, \code{evitals.26}, \code{evitals.29}, and \code{evitals.30} can contain
all the unique values entered per incident, which may cause row explosion.  The function will
handle this issue elegantly under the hood.

The \code{esituation.11} contains single responses per response, but \code{esituation.12} should be a list
column or text field with all relevant secondary provider impression entries provided in a single cell
as comma-separated values for each unique incident.

The first argument to this function is the main data frame. No joins are performed within
the function; any necessary joins (e.g., to incorporate vitals or additional fields) should
be completed prior to calling this function.

Grouping by specific attributes (e.g., region) can be performed inside this function by
utilizing the \code{.by} argument passed via tidydots (i.e. \code{...}) to \code{dplyr::summarize}.

#' @section Practical Tips:

Ensure data are pre-processed, with missing values coded as \code{NA}, before passing
into the function.
Prepare necessary joins (e.g., for vitals) in advance; this function does not perform joins.

\section{Value}{


A summarized tibble with counts and proportions of patients of all ages
who had a 911 response, were suffering from stroke, and had a stroke assessment completed.
}

\section{Features}{

\itemize{
\item \strong{Stroke Case Identification}: Identifies potential stroke cases based on primary and secondary impression codes.
\item \strong{911 Response Filtering}: Filters records to include only those flagged with 911 response codes in \code{eresponse_05_col}.
\item \strong{Glasgow Coma Scale and AVPU Processing}: Analyzes and includes Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores and AVPU levels from vital signs.
\item \strong{Stroke Scale Type and Values Assessment}: Extracts and processes stroke scale information (e.g., FAST, NIH) from the specified columns.
\item \strong{Encounter Aggregation}: Aggregates data by unique patient encounters to provide a summary view of stroke case proportions.
