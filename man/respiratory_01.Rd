\item{epatient_15_col}{Column giving the calculated age value.}

\item{epatient_16_col}{Column giving the provided age unit value.}

\item{eresponse_05_col}{Column name for 911 response codes (e.g., 2205001, 2205003, 2205009).}

\item{esituation_11_col}{Column name for primary impression codes related to respiratory distress.}

\item{esituation_12_col}{Column name for secondary impression codes related to respiratory distress.}

\item{evitals_12_col}{Column name for the first vital sign measurement.}

\item{evitals_14_col}{Column name for the second vital sign measurement.}

\value{
Returns a data frame summarizing the proportion of cases with complete vital sign data, divided by population
}
\description{
The \code{respiratory_01} function filters and analyzes data related to emergency 911 respiratory distress incidents, providing summary statistics for adult and pediatric populations. This function uses specific data columns for 911 response codes, primary and secondary impressions, and vital signs to calculate the proportion of cases with complete vital signs recorded, stratified by age.
}
\section{Assumptions}{

Assume data are already loaded
Need to be a table where each row is 1 observation and each column is a feature
or distinct datasets that can be referenced as unique columns
this function will calculate an age in years
this function also assumes that rows that are missing any value are NA,
not the not known / not recorded values common to ImageTrend or the value codes
that correspond to "not values".
the function assumes that the primary/secondary impression fields have the
ICD-10 code in them.  The text description can be present, too, for reference.
the function assumes that the eresponse.05 column has the codes in it, text
can be present, too, for reference
the function assumes that vitals in the vital signs columns are likely the
first vital signs, or are a list column.  This will give an indication of whether
or not any vitals were taken.
the esituation_12 is best as a list column of the secondary impressions entered
the first argument is a dataframe, no joining is done.
any joins to get vitals etc. will need to be done outside the function
grouping can be done before the function to get the calculations by region
or other grouping
